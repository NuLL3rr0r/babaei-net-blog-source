When Rust developers think of us C++ folks, they picture a cursed bloodline ‚Äî generational trauma passed down from `malloc` to `free`. To them, every line of C++ we write is like playing Russian Roulette ‚Äî except all six chambers are loaded with undefined behavior.

They look at us like we‚Äôre hopeless. Like we‚Äôre one dangling pointer away from therapy. But you know what? We don‚Äôt need a compiler nanny. No borrow checker. No lifetimes. No ownership models. No black magic. Not even Valgrind is required. Just raw pointers, raw determination, and a bit of questionable sanity.

So in this video, I‚Äôm going to show you how to hunt down memory leaks like you were born with a pointer in one hand and a debugger in the other.

If that sounds unreasonably dangerous ‚Äî and incredibly fun ‚Äî smash that subscribe button, and let‚Äôs dive into the deep end of the heap.

## üß∏ ELI5: Explain Like I'm Five

{{< highlight cpp >}}
#define MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER 1

#if MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER
#define _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC
#include <crtdbg.h>

#define DEBUG_NEW new (_NORMAL_BLOCK, __FILE__, __LINE__)
#define new DEBUG_NEW
#endif  /* MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER */
{{< /highlight >}}

Imagine we‚Äôre building LEGO houses, and we sometimes forget to clean up the bricks afterward. This code says: ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs turn on a LEGO brick tracker!‚Äù

It adds a magic camera (`<crtdbg.h>`) that watches where we drop bricks. And when we use `new` to build something, it secretly adds **who** built it and **where** in the code. So if we forget to clean up, we‚Äôll know exactly **who made the mess** and **where**.

üí° **Technical Explanation**:

- `#define _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC`: Replaces calls to `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` with debug versions that track source file and line number.
- `#include <crtdbg.h>`: Gives access to Microsoft's debug heap and leak-checking functions (only available on Windows with MSVC in debug builds).
- The `#define new DEBUG_NEW` trick: Replaces every usage of `new` with a debug version that logs the file and line where the allocation happened. This makes it possible to pinpoint **exactly where a leak originated**.

**tl;dr;** `DEBUG_NEW` and `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` tracks `new`/`malloc` calls with file and line information.

---

{{< highlight cpp >}}
int32_t main() {
#if MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER
    int dbgFlags = _CrtSetDbgFlag(_CRTDBG_REPORT_FLAG);
    dbgFlags |= _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF;
    _CrtSetDbgFlag(dbgFlags);

    // Only track one allocation per run!
    // e.g. allocation number that causes leaks:
    //_CrtSetBreakAlloc(162);
#endif  /* MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER */
{{< /highlight >}}

This part tells the camera **what to look for**. It turns on its ‚Äúleak detector goggles‚Äù so it can see every piece of memory we forgot to put away.

And that `_CrtSetBreakAlloc(162);` line? That‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúWhen you see the **162nd LEGO block**, pause everything! I want to look at that one under a microscope.‚Äù

üí° **Technical Explanation**:

- `_CrtSetDbgFlag(...)`: Sets runtime flags to enable memory leak tracking and automatic leak reporting at program exit.
- `DBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF`: Tells the debug heap to keep track of memory allocations.
- `DBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF`: Automatically calls `_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks()` when `main()` exits.
- `_CrtSetBreakAlloc(162)`: Sets a **breakpoint on the 162nd allocation** (as counted internally by the CRT heap). When hit, Visual Studio will pause execution so you can inspect the allocation causing issues. You can comment this line out unless you're trying to isolate a specific leak in a large program.

**tl;dr;** `_CrtSetDbgFlag(...)` enables runtime heap tracking and leak reports; `_CrtSetBreakAlloc(N)` lets you break on a specific allocation number.

---

{{< highlight cpp >}}
#if MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER
    _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();
#endif  /* MEMORY_LEAK_TRACKER */

    return 0;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

At the very end, we tell the camera: ‚ÄúOkay, show me everything we forgot to clean up.‚Äù

It dumps out a report saying, ‚ÄúHey! You left a brick at line `42`! And another one at line `57`!‚Äù

üí° **Technical Explanation**:

- Manually triggers a leak report right before program shutdown.
- This is **optional** if you already enabled `_CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF` ‚Äî the CRT will dump leaks automatically.
- But calling it manually gives you control over when the leak dump happens (e.g., before global/static destruction).

**tl;dr;** `_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks()` manually prints out leak information with pointer and size.
